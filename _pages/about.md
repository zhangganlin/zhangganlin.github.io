Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the
[Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy](https://wc.wustl.edu/) 
and [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/) at
[Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). I am also an
affiliated researcher with the
[Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org) lab. I specialize
in International Relations and Political Methodology. I earned my Ph.D in
Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/).

My work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*,
*Political Science Research and Methods*, and *PS: Political Science & Politics*,
among other outlets. My [research](research) explores the causes and
consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as
latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While I primarily
focus on civil conflict, I also examine contentious political phenomena
including terrorism and economic statecraft, and develop new measures of
institutions in international relations. I have [teaching](teaching) experience
in both international relations and quantitative methodology, and am a certified
instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
